    "# Random walk decision making model simulations\n",
    "Random walk decision making models are pervasive in psychology and neuroscience research. They also serve as a good example of how human intuition can lead one astray without the aid of a model. Here, we explore a simplified random walk model, focusing on the question of whether or not changes in drift rate modulates response speed."

Implementing the model and leveraging simulations allow for correct understanding of its predictions for decision making."
