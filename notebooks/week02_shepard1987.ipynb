This homework is designed more as a tutorial than an assignment, so don't fret about how much you do or don't know about coding. Hopefully, the steps below will ease you into implementing Shepard's model. Just look for `??` in the coding cells as you work through this notebook. These cells are missing code that you need to add. \n",
