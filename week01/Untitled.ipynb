    "What is memory? Remembering things from the past, right? But, to remember something, you had to put that something in memory in the first place. So, to have a memory, we need to be able to store experiences into memory (i.e., memory encoding) and then retrieve those experiences from memory (i.e., memory retrieval). That means you go through life experiencing different events which are stored into memory through encoding functions and then later remembered through retrieval functions. That sounds like memory!\n",

    "Not a bad start for a theory, but let's make it more formal. To make things easier, let's assume any experience can be defined by a set of binary features (that means they take on one of two values). We will make it really simple by saying that there are only 6 features that define an experience. With these simple assumptions, we can start the create different experiences:"
